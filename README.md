This is set up as good boilerplate, it allows you to connect to the websockets
and send in spot trades on the testnet. Whoever takes it from here can take the 
test net configurations out of the code, add in the calls to the websocket or 
rest API endpoints to place trades. Either endpoint will work for this purpose>

I set everything to market in and market out, i would recommend using limits after
you are in a position for the take profit and stop loss numbers, the function has 
been defined already so it should be easy to change.

This is all i can think of for now, I just cant connect to binance to test for 
anything other than spot. So im limited on what i can do.
